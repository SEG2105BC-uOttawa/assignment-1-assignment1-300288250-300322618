As we can see from the data presented, the construction time and the iteration time of the ArrayList takes the longest for any collection size. We can see that the time for the construction and iteration of a Vector takes less time.
However, the construction as well as the iteration of an Array takes the least amount of time, making it the most time efficient out of all three of them. 
So, from these conclusions, it would be recommended to use Arrays out of all of them as they are the most time efficient.
